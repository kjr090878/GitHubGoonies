I worked with TableView and JSON to retrieve login and avatar images.

---

- I imported Foundation
	
	- I used API roots and endpoints to pull in login and avatar info into the app.

- I imported UIKit

	- Used Table View Controllers and embedded Navigation View Controllers to build the app to accept images as an avatar and login functions.
